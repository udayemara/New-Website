        Erling Braut Haaland (n√© H√•land; Urban East Norwegian: [Ààh√≤Àêl…ën];[5] born 21 July 2000) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Manchester City and the Norway national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his speed, strength, positioning, and finishing inside the box. In his debut Premier League season, Haaland broke the record for the most goals scored by a player in a single season, with 36.[6]
        
        Coming through the youth system, Haaland played for Norwegian sides Bryne and Molde, before relocating to Austria with Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019. His performances there earned him a move to Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, where he won the DFB-Pokal in 2021. In the summer of 2022, he transferred to Manchester City for a fee of ‚Ç¨60 million (¬£51.2 million), and was instrumental in the club winning a continental treble in his debut campaign; his 52 goals across all competitions was the most ever for a Premier League player. Haaland was named the league's Young Player and Player of the Season, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year.
        
        Haaland has won several individual awards and broken various records during his career, including the 2020 Golden Boy award, while in 2021 he was named Bundesliga Player of the Season, in addition to his inclusion in the FIFA FIFPro World11 for both 2021 and 2022. He has also broken multiple Premier League records, including most goals scored in a season, the quickest individual to score two, three, four and five hat-tricks, and the first in league history to score hat-tricks in three consecutive home games. In 2023, he won the Premier League Golden Boot, the European Golden Shoe and the Gerd M√ºller Trophy for his goalscoring success. In the same year, his performances led him to be named UEFA Men's Player of the Year and finish runner-up in the Ballon d'Or.
        
        Haaland has represented Norway at various youth levels. In the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, he won the tournament's Golden Boot after scoring a record nine goals in a single match. He made his senior international debut in September 2019, and is currently the nation's second-highest all-time top goalscorer.
        
        Early life
        Haaland was born on 21 July 2000 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, as his father Alf-Inge Haaland was playing for Leeds United in the Premier League at the time.[7] In 2004, at the age of three, he moved to Bryne, his parents' hometown in Norway.[8][9] Along with playing football from an early age, Haaland took part in various other sports as a child, including handball, golf, and track and field.[10] He also reportedly achieved a world record in his age category for the standing long jump when he was five, with a recorded distance of 1.63 metres in 2006.[11]
        
        Club career
        Bryne
        Haaland started in the academy of his hometown club Bryne at the age of five.[12][13] During the 2015‚Äì16 season, he played for Bryne's reserve team and impressed, scoring 18 goals in 14 matches.[14] In May 2016, Gaute Larsen was sacked as Bryne manager and youth coach Berntsen was promoted to caretaker boss. Having worked closely with Haaland in other youth teams, the interim manager handed the teenager his first start, three months before his 16th birthday.[15][13] His debut was a second-tier 1. divisjon match against Ranheim on 12 May.[16]
        
        After having initially being deployed as a winger, Berntsen put Haaland in his favoured central role as a striker after a few matches. Although he failed to score in his breakthrough season at Bryne, Haaland was offered a trial by German club 1899 Hoffenheim before eventually moving to Molde to play under Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r.[15] Haaland made 16 total senior appearances for Bryne.[14]</p>
